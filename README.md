# Applied-Statistics-World-Happiness

The World Happiness Report is a seminal study of worldwide happiness. The report's global acclaim is growing as governments, organizations, and civil society increasingly utilize happiness metrics to influence policy decisions. The Gallup World Poll data is used to calculate happiness ratings and rankings. The columns that follow the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity.

We have demonstrated various aspects in the project such as:
1. Measures of Centrality
2. Measures of Variability
3. Descriptive Statistics
4. Hypothesis Testing: Covid-19 didn't affect the overall happiness scores
5. Confidence Interval Estimation
6. t-test for two populations
7. Informative Dashboards

## Inferences
1. The Happiness Score is a normal distribution.
2. There is no sufficient evidence to prove that the happiness scores changed after covid-19.
3. Countries with similar happiness score tend to be in the same geographic vicinity.
4. There are strong correlations between Happiness scores and the dependent variables as discussed earlier.
5. We also selected the best multivariate linear regression model that can be used to predict the Happiness score.
